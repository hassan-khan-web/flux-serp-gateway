This paved the way for the first-ever FIFA World Cup to be held in 1930. Uruguay were hosts as they celebrated 100 years of independence and had also won gold at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. Uruguay also went on to lift the trophy at home, beating Argentina 4-2 in the final to be crowned the first FIFA World Cup champions.

FIFA, the international governing body of football, was formed in 1904 and it organised the football competition at the Antwerp 1920 Olympics, which was recognised as an inter-continental competition. This paved the way for the first-ever FIFA World Cup to be held in 1930. Uruguay were hosts as they celebrated 100 years of independence and had also won gold at the 1924 and 1928 Olympics. Uruguay also went on to lift the trophy at home, beating Argentina 4-2 in the final to be crowned the first FIFA World Cup champions.

Released theatrically by Buena Vista Pictures Distribution through Touchstone Pictures on March 10, 2000, the film was both a critical and commercial disappointment. ## Plot [edit] [...] ## Plot [edit] In 2020, the Mars I mission travels to the planet Mars, commanded by Luke Graham. The team discovers a bright white formation in the Cydonia region \"Cydonia (region of Mars)\"), which they suspect is an extrusion from a subsurface geothermal column of water, useful to future human colonization. After reporting this to the Earth-orbiting World Space Station, they investigate the formation and start hearing a low sound on their communications system. Their radar reports the formation is metal, but when they increase its power, a vortex kills everyone except Luke and the formation is revealed to be part of a large humanoid face. [...] The three astronauts enter the opening, which seals behind them. A three-dimensional projection of the Solar System depicts Mars, covered with water, being struck by a large asteroid and rendered uninhabitable. A projection of a humanoid Martian lifeform reveals the native Martians evacuated the planet in spaceships, one of which was sent to seed Earth with DNA to create life that could one day land on Mars and be recognized as descendants. An invitation is offered for one of their group to follow the Martians to their new home. Jim accepts the invitation and is sealed inside a small capsule. Terri and Luke arrive back to the ERV just as Phil is about to take off.\n\n### 4. The Martian (film) - Wikipedia (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Martian_(film)\nSnippet: In 2035, the crew of the Ares III mission to Mars is exploring Acidalia Planitia on Martian solar day (sol) 18 of their 31-sol expedition. A severe dust storm threatens their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) and in the ensuing evacuation, astronaut Mark Watney is struck by flying debris and presumed dead. Facing imminent peril, the remaining crew takes off for their orbiting vessel, the _Hermes_, which will then return them to Earth. Watney awakens after the storm, having narrowly survived his injuries. As he recovers within the crew's surface habitat (\"Hab\"), he begins a video diary to document his thoughts on survival. Unable to communicate with Earth, his only chance of rescue is the next Mars mission in four years, when Ares IV will land at the Schiaparelli crater \"Schiaparelli (Martian [...] _The Martian_ is a 2015 epicscience fiction film directed by Ridley Scott from a screenplay by Drew Goddard. Based on Andy Weir's 2011 novel \"The Martian (Weir novel)\"), and distributed by 20th Century Fox, the film stars Matt Damon, alongside an ensemble cast featuring Jessica Chastain, Jeff Daniels, Kristen Wiig, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Sean Bean, Michael Pe\u00f1a, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan, and Mackenzie Davis. The film depicts an astronaut's struggle to survive on Mars after being left behind and NASA's efforts to return him to Earth. [...] On Earth, NASA satellite planner Mindy Park notices Watney's activity from recorded satellite images, and suspects he must be alive. NASA director Teddy Sanders releases the news to the public but decides not to inform the Ares III crew en route to Earth, over flight director Mitch Henderson's strong objection. Watney explores the surrounding terrain and studies his maps, but he quickly journeys out to retrieve the _Pathfinder_ probe, hoping to restore its communications. Mars missions director Vincent Kapoor realizes this strategy, and quickly visits Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) director Bruce Ng to use their replica of the probe. The agency makes contact with Watney and instructs him to link _Pathfinder_ to the rover, where he can now communicate by text.\n\n### 5. \u201cThe Martian\u201d explained in detailed \u2014 Planexto (Credibility Score: 0.4)\nURL: https://medium.com/@planexto10/the-martian-explained-in-detailed-planexto-4ad46a6be22f\nSnippet: Sitemap Open in app Sign in Write Search Sign in # \u201cThe Martian\u201d explained in detailed \u2014 Planexto Planexto 2 min read \u00b7 Jan 4, 2024 -- \u201cThe Martian\u201d is a 2015 science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott, based on Andy Weir\u2019s 2011 novel of the same name. The movie features an ensemble cast led by Matt Damon as Mark Watney. Here is a detailed plot summary: Mission to Mars The story begins with the Ares III space mission to Mars. Mark Watney, an astronaut and botanist, is presumed dead after a violent dust storm forces the crew to evacuate. As they leave the planet, they lose communication with Watney and assume he is dead. However, Watney survives, waking up to find himself alone on Mars. [...] Surviving on Mars Watney assesses his situation, realizing he has limited supplies and needs to survive until the next manned mission to Mars arrives, which is years away. Using his ingenuity and resourcefulness, Watney engineers solutions to grow food, generate water, and establish communication with NASA. He modifies the habitat, creating a sustainable environment. Back on Earth, satellite images reveal Watney\u2019s survival, and NASA learns he is alive. The news shocks the Ares III crew, who are on their way back to Earth. NASA begins working on a plan to rescue Watney, facing challenges like the limited resources of the Hermes spacecraft and the unpredictable nature of Mars. [...] Watney\u2019s challenges Watney faces life-threatening situations during his journey, including a sandstorm and the loss of communication with NASA. The crew of the Hermes risks their own safety to perform a daring and unplanned gravity assist around Earth, allowing them to return to Mars faster. Happy Ending Watney reaches the Ares IV MAV and prepares for the final stage of his journey. The Ares III crew coordinates with NASA to execute a mid-space rendezvous, successfully rescuing Watney. The crew returns to Earth, and Watney is reunited with his family and colleagues. \u201cThe Martian\u201d is a compelling story of survival, human ingenuity, and the collaborative efforts of individuals and organizations to overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges in the harsh environment of Mars.\n",

It\u2019s based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are designed to mimic the way neurons in our brains process information. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning refers to the multiple layers in these neural networks. Each layer processes the input data and passes it on to the next layer, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex features of the data. This hierarchical learning process enables deep learning models to handle large amounts of unstructured data and perform complex tasks with remarkable accuracy. Deep learning has achieved incredible breakthroughs in several areas: [...] Hardware and computational power: Deep learning models, especially when training on large datasets, often require significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs. Machine learning algorithms generally have lower hardware requirements and can often run efficiently on standard CPUs. Algorithm complexity: Machine learning uses comparatively straightforward algorithms like linear regression or decision trees. Deep learning employs complex, multi-layered neural networks that can model highly non-linear relationships in data. Pace of model training: Machine learning models typically train faster than deep learning models. However, given enough training time and data, deep learning models can potentially achieve higher accuracy, especially for complex tasks. [...] 1. Data size and type: If you have large datasets, especially unstructured data like images or text, deep learning might be more suitable. For smaller, structured datasets, traditional machine learning algorithms often suffice. 2. Task complexity: For complex tasks like image recognition or natural language understanding, deep learning typically outperforms traditional machine learning. For simpler tasks or when interpretability is critical, machine learning might be preferable. 3. Computational resources: Consider your available hardware and time constraints. Deep learning often requires more powerful hardware and longer training times.",

Deep learning requires large datasets and more computational power.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Deep Learning vs Machine Learning: Whats the Difference? (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.anaconda.com/topics/deep-learning-vs-machine-learning\nSnippet: ## What is Deep Learning? Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It\u2019s based on artificial neural networks (ANNs), which are designed to mimic the way neurons in our brains process information. The \u201cdeep\u201d in deep learning refers to the multiple layers in these neural networks. Each layer processes the input data and passes it on to the next layer, allowing the network to learn increasingly complex features of the data. This hierarchical learning process enables deep learning models to handle large amounts of unstructured data and perform complex tasks with remarkable accuracy. Deep learning has achieved incredible breakthroughs in several areas: [...] Hardware and computational power: Deep learning models, especially when training on large datasets, often require significant computational resources, including powerful GPUs. Machine learning algorithms generally have lower hardware requirements and can often run efficiently on standard CPUs. Algorithm complexity: Machine learning uses comparatively straightforward algorithms like linear regression or decision trees. Deep learning employs complex, multi-layered neural networks that can model highly non-linear relationships in data. Pace of model training: Machine learning models typically train faster than deep learning models. However, given enough training time and data, deep learning models can potentially achieve higher accuracy, especially for complex tasks. [...] 1. Data size and type: If you have large datasets, especially unstructured data like images or text, deep learning might be more suitable. For smaller, structured datasets, traditional machine learning algorithms often suffice. 2. Task complexity: For complex tasks like image recognition or natural language understanding, deep learning typically outperforms traditional machine learning. For simpler tasks or when interpretability is critical, machine learning might be preferable. 3. Computational resources: Consider your available hardware and time constraints. Deep learning often requires more powerful hardware and longer training times.\n\n### 2. Deep Learning vs. Machine Learning - Azure Machine Learning (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-deep-learning-vs-machine-learning?view=azureml-api-2\nSnippet: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that's based on artificial neural networks. The learning process is deep because the structure of artificial neural networks consists of multiple input, output, and hidden layers. Each layer contains units that transform the input data into information that the next layer can use for a certain predictive task. Because of this structure, a machine can learn through its own data processing. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that uses techniques (such as deep learning) that enable machines to use experience to improve their ability to perform tasks. The learning process is composed of the following steps: [...] By using machine learning and deep learning techniques, you can build computer systems and applications that do tasks that are commonly associated with human intelligence. These tasks include image recognition, speech recognition, and language translation. ## Techniques of deep learning and machine learning Now that you have a basic understanding of how machine learning differs from deep learning, let's compare the two techniques. In machine learning, the algorithm needs to be told how to make an accurate prediction by consuming more information. (For example, by performing feature extraction.) In deep learning, the algorithm can learn how to make an accurate prediction through its own data processing because it uses the artificial neural network structure. [...] This article compares deep learning to machine learning and describes how they fit into the broader category of AI.

Pessimistic vs Optimistic Locking - System Design Codex (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://newsletter.systemdesigncodex.com/p/pessimistic-vs-optimistic-locking\nSnippet: ## What Is Pessimistic Locking? Pessimistic locking takes a \"better safe than sorry\" approach. It assumes that conflicts are likely to happen, so it locks the data preemptively before any updates are made. ### How It Works: When a user or process wants to read and update a piece of data: 1. It acquires a lock on the data. 2. Other users/processes are blocked from accessing or modifying that data until the lock is released. 3. Once the operation is complete, the lock is released. This strategy is often enforced at the database level, using exclusive locks (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` in SQL). ### Advantages: \u2705 Guarantees data integrity\u2014conflicts are prevented before they can happen. \u2705 Ideal for critical updates, such as financial transactions or inventory management.\n",

Let's explore these benefits in more detail. ### 1. Structured Work Environment [...] ### Is remote or in-person work more productive? > Whether remote or in-person work is more productive depends on individual preferences and job requirements. Some find remote work more fruitful due to its flexibility and fewer office distractions, while others thrive in the structured environment of in-person work with direct team collaboration. Productivity varies based on personal work style and the nature of the tasks. ## Summing Up The debate between remote work and office work depends on the job's nature, employees' needs, and company goals. Remote work offers flexibility, increased work-life balance, and cost savings for employees and employers. In contrast, office work fosters direct collaboration and provides a structured environment. [...] ## Remote Work Pros and Cons - A Quick Overview | Pros | Cons | --- | | Flexibility in work hours | Communication challenges | | Cost savings on commuting and attire | Isolation and lack of social interaction | | Improved work-life balance | Difficulty in separating work and personal life | | Access to global talent and higher retention | Technology dependency | | Enhanced productivity | | Increased employee engagement and job satisfaction | | Reduced carbon footprint | | Reduced business and infrastructure costs | ## Pros of Remote Work The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the remote working trend.

Access to a Wider Talent Pool: Employers can hire the best talent regardless of geographic location, leading to more diverse and skilled teams. Less Exposure to Illness: Especially relevant in the wake of the pandemic, working from home can mean less exposure to contagious illnesses, which is beneficial for both employee health and overall public health. Better for the Environment: Remote work can reduce the environmental impact by decreasing the number of commuters, thus lowering emissions and reducing a company\u2019s carbon footprint. [...] ### 5. Difficulty with work-life balance Remote work can sometimes lead to a poor work-life balance as the boundaries between \u2018work time\u2019 and \u2018personal time\u2019 become less distinct. This can result in working longer hours, difficulty in switching off after work, and a feeling of being constantly connected to work responsibilities. ###### Related Article ##### Top Remote Work Challenges and Solutions You Need To Know Chris Reaburn ## Pros of Working in an Office ### 1.

A list comprehension consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a `for` clause, then zero or more `for` or `if` clauses. The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the `for` and `if` clauses which follow it. For example, this listcomp combines the elements of two lists if they are not equal: ``` >>> [(x, y) for x in[1, 2, 3] for y in[3, 1, 4] if x!= y][(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)] ``` and it\u2019s equivalent to: ``` >>> combs =[]>>> for x in[1, 2, 3]:... for y in[3, 1, 4]:... if x!= y:... combs. append((x, y))...>>> combs[(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 4)] ``` [...] List comprehensions can contain complex expressions and nested functions: ``` >>> from math import pi>>> [str(round(pi, i)) for i in range(1, 6)]['3.1', '3.14', '3.142', '3.1416', '3.14159'] ``` ### 5.1.4. Nested List Comprehensions\u00b6 The initial expression in a list comprehension can be any arbitrary expression, including another list comprehension. Consider the following example of a 3x4 matrix implemented as a list of 3 lists of length 4: ``` >>> matrix =[... [1, 2, 3, 4],... [5, 6, 7, 8],... [9, 10, 11, 12],... ] ``` The following list comprehension will transpose rows and columns: ``` >>> ``` As we saw in the previous section, the inner list comprehension is evaluated in the context of the `for` that follows it, so this example is equivalent to: [...] ^^^^^^^ SyntaxError did you forget parentheses around the comprehension target?\n\n### 3.

Python List Comprehension (With Examples) - Programiz (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/list-comprehension\nSnippet: Python List Comprehension ## Syntax of List Comprehension `[expression for item in list if condition == True]` Here, for every `item` in `list`, execute the `expression` `if` the `condition` is `True`. `item` `list` `expression` `if` `condition` `True` Note: The `if` statement in list comprehension is optional. `if` ## for Loop vs. List Comprehension List comprehension makes the code cleaner and more concise than `for` loop. `for` Let's write a program to print the square of each list element using both `for` loop and list comprehension. `for` for Loop `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] square_numbers = [] # for loop to square each elements for num in numbers: square_numbers.append(num num) print(square_numbers) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` List Comprehension [...] List Comprehension `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] # create a new list using list comprehension square_numbers = [num num for num in numbers] print(square_numbers) # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]` It's much easier to understand list comprehension once you know Python for loop(). ## Conditionals in List Comprehension List comprehensions can utilize conditional statements like if\u2026else to filter existing lists. Let's see an example of an `if` statement with list comprehension. `if` `# filtering even numbers from a list even_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 10) if num % 2 == 0 ] print(even_numbers) # Output: [2, 4, 6, 8]` Here, list comprehension checks if the number from `range(1, 10)` is even or odd. If even, it appends the number in the list. `range(1, 10)` [...] ### Python Data types ### Python Functions ### Python Files ### Python Exception Handling ### Python Object & Class ### Python Advanced Topics ### Python Date and Time ### Additional Topic ### Python Tutorials # Python List Comprehension List comprehension offers a concise way to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

Python - List Comprehension - W3Schools (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists_comprehension.asp\nSnippet: \u276e Previous Next \u276f ## List Comprehension List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list. Example: Based on a list of fruits, you want a new list, containing only the fruits with the letter \"a\" in the name. Without list comprehension you will have to write a `for` statement with a conditional test inside: ### Example fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"kiwi\", \"mango\"] newlist = [] for x in fruits: if \"a\" in x: newlist.append(x) print(newlist) Try it Yourself \u00bb With list comprehension you can do all that with only one line of code: ### Example fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\", \"kiwi\", \"mango\"] newlist = [x for x in fruits if \"a\" in x] print(newlist) Try it Yourself \u00bb [...] Try it Yourself \u00bb --- ## The Syntax newlist = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True] The return value is a new list, leaving the old list unchanged. ### Condition The condition is like a filter that only accepts the items that evaluate to `True`. ### Example Only accept items that are not \"apple\": newlist = [x for x in fruits if x != \"apple\"] Try it Yourself \u00bb The condition if x != \"apple\" will return `True` for all elements other than \"apple\", making the new list contain all fruits except \"apple\". The condition is optional and can be omitted: ### Example With no `if` statement: newlist = [x for x in fruits] Try it Yourself \u00bb ### Iterable The iterable can be any iterable object, like a list, tuple, set etc. ### Example [...] ### Example You can use the `range()` function to create an iterable: newlist = [x for x in range(10)] Try it Yourself \u00bb Same example, but with a condition: ### Example Accept only numbers lower than 5: newlist = [x for x in range(10) if x < 5] Try it Yourself \u00bb ### Expression The expression is the current item in the iteration, but it is also the outcome, which you can manipulate before it ends up like a list item in the new list: ### Example Set the values in the new list to upper case: newlist = [x.\n",

When light traveling through the air enters a different medium, such as glass or water, the speed and wavelength of light are reduced (see Figure 2), although the frequency remains unaltered. Light travels at approximately 300,000 kilometers per second in a vacuum, which has a refractive index of 1.0, but it slows down to 225,000 kilometers per second in water (refractive index of 1.3; see Figure 2) and 200,000 kilometers per second in glass (refractive index of 1.5). In diamond, with a rather high refractive index of 2.4, the speed of light is reduced to a relative crawl (125,000 kilometers per second), being about 60 percent less than its maximum speed in a vacuum. [...] ## How Fast Is the Speed of Light The speed of light, which scientists have thoroughly examined, is now expressed as a constant value denoted in equations by the symbol c. Not truly a constant, but rather the maximum speed in a vacuum, the speed of light in km, which is almost 300,000 kilometers per second, can be manipulated by changing media or with quantum interference. [...] ## James Bradley\u2019s Speed of Light Estimations The next in line to provide a useful estimate of the speed of light was the British physicist James Bradley. In 1728, a year after Newton's death, Bradley estimated the speed of light in a vacuum to be approximately 301,000 kilometers per second, using stellar aberrations. These phenomena are manifested by an apparent variation in the position of stars due to the motion of the Earth around the sun. The degree of stellar aberration can be determined from the ratio of the Earth's orbital speed to the speed of light. By measuring the stellar aberration angle and applying that data to the orbital speed of the Earth, Bradley was able to arrive at a remarkably accurate estimate.",

According to physicist Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, on which much of modern physics is based, nothing in the universe can travel faster than light. The theory states that as matter approaches the speed of light, the matter's mass becomes infinite. That means the speed of light functions as a speed limit for the whole universe.

[...] ### When to use NoSQL While SQL is valued for ensuring data validity, NoSQL is good when it\u2019s more important that the availability of big data is fast. It\u2019s also a good choice when a company will need to scale because of changing requirements. NoSQL is easy-to-use, flexible and offers high performance. [...] NoSQL is also a good choice when there are large amounts of (or ever-changing) data sets or when working with flexible data models or needs that don\u2019t fit into a relational model. When working with large amounts of unstructured data, document databases (e.g., CouchDB, MongoDB, and Amazon DocumentDB) are a good fit. For quick access to a key-value store without strong integrity guarantees, Redis may be the best choice. When a complex or flexible search across a lot of data is needed, Elastic Search is a good choice.\n\n### 3. Benchmarking Databases for Real-Time Analytics Applications (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://dev.to/tigerdata/benchmarking-databases-for-real-time-analytics-applications-f2d\nSnippet: I mentioned NewSQL (F1, TiDB). I mentioned also NOSQL which stands for not only sql. You probably meant \"anythings that is not structured query language\". I worked with many databases where size varies between gigabyte and sizes given as just an exponent scale (you rarely call anything over terabytes with name and petabytes are at the border of calling them with a name). MySQL is a database with many cool features but also an interface. Same for postgresql. Look at yugabyte. Search for scalable attempts to make Mysql or postgres. Play with elastic and mongo. Then look at cassandra which claims to be full CAP. After all the steps you might be closer to understand why your view might be wrong. [...] Skip to content ## DEV Community James Blackwood-Sewell for Tiger Data (Creators of TimescaleDB) Posted on # Benchmarking Databases for Real-Time Analytics Applications #opensource #database #postgres Choosing the right database for analytics is hard. With many options available, each is optimized for different use cases. Some databases are built for real-time analytics in customer-facing applications, where low-latency queries and high-ingest performance are essential. Others are designed for internal BI and reporting and optimized for large-scale aggregations and batch processing. Some databases are general-purpose, handling both transactions and analytics, while others specialize in analytical workloads. [...] RTABench categorizes databases into: 1. General-purpose databases: e.g., PostgreSQL and MySQL. 2. Real-time analytics databases: Optimized for quick insights, often secondary databases. 3. Batch analytics databases: Primarily for historical data and excluded from real-time benchmarks. Benchmark Results: What We Learned RTABench results are published at rtabench.com.\n\n### 4. Best database for real time analytics in 2026 and how to choose (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.tinybird.co/blog/best-database-for-real-time-analytics\nSnippet: If you know databases, you know that Postgres, MySQL, and many other popular databases won't feasibly satisfy all these criteria. Few databases can. ## What is a real-time database? A real-time analytics database (aka a real-time database) is simply a database that can support the five facets of real-time analytics at scale: 1. High Data Freshness 2. Low Query Latency 3. High Query Complexity 4. High Query Concurrency 5. Long Data Retention [...] ### What are some examples of analytics databases? Some common databases used for analytics include MongoDB, Snowflake, Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Databricks, ClickHouse\u00ae, Apache Druid, Apache Pinot, Apache Cassandra, Apache HBase, ElasticSearch, and DynamoDB. Cloud-native alternatives like Databend offer elastic scaling by separating storage and compute. MySQL-derived options like MariaDB ColumnStore add columnar capabilities to the familiar MySQL interface. [...] ### Real-Time Use Cases Across Industries Real-time analytics is not a single pattern \u2014 it\u2019s a requirement across multiple industries.\n\n### 5. SQL vs. NoSQL: The Differences Explained + When to Use Each (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.coursera.org/articles/nosql-vs-sql\nSnippet: A non-relational NoSQL database doesn\u2019t use structured tables but instead uses flexible schemas for unstructured data storage. This gives you more ability to scale your project as needed. However, it also means you have less control over consistency and data relationships. Here are some situations where NoSQL might make the most sense to you: You need high performance, particularly read performance: The way distributed NoSQL systems like Cassandra and Riak work means you can usually get very high read performance by adding more boxes. Some even automatically replicate data across nodes to ensure you always have plenty of copies of your data to access. [...] NoSQL non-relational databases work well with unstructured data and typically possess the following properties: NoSQL is schema-less (no fixed data model). NoSQL databases have a dynamic schema for unstructured data, making data integration in certain types of applications easier and faster. NoSQL uses non-tabular data models, which can be document-oriented, key-value, or graph-based. The most common NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase, Redis, Neo4j, and CouchDB.\n",

Unsurprisingly, then, poetry about the ocean takes many shapes. From a simple contemplation of the sea to a reflection of our own lives.

If your app requires significant customization or needs to scale rapidly, Android may offer the flexibility needed to meet those requirements. However, if you're aiming for a simpler, more controlled app ecosystem with high consistency, iOS might be a better fit for scalability. 7) You needs It\u2019s also essential to evaluate the specific needs of your app. For example, if you require heavy customization, deeper system integration, or a more flexible UI, Android\u2019s open-source nature may be a better fit. [...] 3) Cost of development and ROI iOS development tends to be more cost-effective in the long run, given its streamlined environment and higher potential for revenue generation.

It can detect various memory-related issues, including leaks, with minimal impact on execution time. ASan modifies your program at compile-time to include instrumentation code that checks each memory operation. When a leak is detected, ASan provides detailed information about the leak's location and the stack trace. [...] Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) whenever possible, as they automatically manage memory for you, freeing it when the pointer goes out of scope. Adopt RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles to ensure that resources are properly released when they're no longer needed. Be cautious with ownership semantics, especially in complex data structures or when using raw pointers. Clearly define which part of your code is responsible for freeing memory. Regularly review and test your code for memory management issues, integrating tools like Valgrind or ASan into your development and testing workflows. [...] #### Visual Studio CRT Debug Heap Functions For developers using Microsoft Visual Studio, the CRT (C Runtime Library) includes debug heap functions that can help detect memory leaks. By defining `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` and including , these functions replace the normal memory allocation functions with debug versions that record information about each allocation. At the program's exit, you can automatically generate a report of all memory allocations that were not freed, indicating potential leaks. This feature is particularly useful for quick checks during development.",

Valgrind: A powerful tool for Linux that can detect various memory-related issues. 3. Address Sanitizer: A fast memory error detector for C++ (and C) programs. 4. Custom Leak Detectors: You can implement your own leak detection system by overriding global new and delete operators. ## Conclusion Memory leaks are indeed the silent killers of C++ programs. They lurk in the shadows, slowly degrading performance until they finally cause a crash. But armed with the right knowledge and tools, you can keep these resource-hungry bugs at bay. [...] ## Why Are Memory Leaks Dangerous? 1. Resource Hogging: Your program will use more memory than it actually needs, potentially starving other applications. 2. Performance Degradation: As available memory decreases, your program (and possibly your entire system) will slow down. 3. Crashes: In extreme cases, your program might exhaust all available memory and crash. 4. Hidden Bugs: Memory leaks can be tricky to spot and may only manifest under certain conditions, making them a nightmare to debug. ## Common Causes of Memory Leaks in C++ 1. Forgetting to Delete: The most obvious cause is allocating memory with `new` and forgetting to `delete` it. [...] ``` void riskyFunction() { int ptr = new int; // Some code that might throw an exception delete[] ptr;}void riskyFunction() void riskyFunction() int new int 1000 // Some code that might throw an exception delete ``` ## How to Prevent Memory Leaks 1. Use Smart Pointers: std::unique\\_ptr and std::shared\\_ptr can automatically manage memory for you. ``` void smartFunction() { auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42); // No need to delete! ptr will clean up after itself}void smartFunction() void smartFunction() auto make_unique int 42 // No need to delete! ptr will clean up after itself ``` 1.

[...] Step 4: Fixing the Leak Once you have identified the leak, you need to ensure that every dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated. In the above example, the allocation happened in my\\_program.cpp at line 6. You\u2019d go to that line and see what\u2019s missing \u2014 likely a delete or delete[] statement.

[...] The -g flag includes debugging information in the binary, which is helpful for ASan to report errors with file names and line numbers. The -O1 is an optimization level that is compatible with ASan; higher levels might interfere with the sanitizer\u2019s ability to detect issues. Step 2: Running the Program Run your program as usual. AddressSanitizer will monitor the execution and report any memory leaks or other memory issues it detects. ``` ./my_program ``` Step 3: Interpreting the Output If AddressSanitizer finds a memory leak, it will print a detailed report that includes the location where the leaked memory was allocated and where the program exited without freeing it.",

Repeat your suspicious code (or run your program long enough) and dump the result with ms\\_print. Usually, the call stack is giving you enough information to fix it. With GDB, you can try to attach to a running program and call functions such as `malloc_stats()` If your program is written in a different language, it might be more tricky. Recently, some GDB has gained scriptability, and people started interesting projects such as gdb-heap, which can analyze Python memory from a core dump.

The built-in VS leak detector only gives the line where new/malloc was called from, but I have a wrapper for allocations, so a full symbolic stack trace would be best. The detector would also be able to detect for a leak in both the .exe and its accompanying plug-in .dll modules.

The Art of Detecting Memory Leaks in C++ Applications - HackerOne (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.hackerone.com/blog/art-detecting-memory-leaks-c-applications\nSnippet: ``` valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all --track-origins=yes --verbose --log-file=memcheck.log ./your_application ``` This command runs your application under Memcheck's supervision, producing a detailed log file (`memcheck.log`) containing information about memory leaks and other memory-related issues. #### AddressSanitizer AddressSanitizer (ASan) is a fast memory error detector integrated into compilers like GCC and Clang. It can detect various memory-related issues, including leaks, with minimal impact on execution time. ASan modifies your program at compile-time to include instrumentation code that checks each memory operation. When a leak is detected, ASan provides detailed information about the leak's location and the stack trace. [...] Use smart pointers (e.g., `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) whenever possible, as they automatically manage memory for you, freeing it when the pointer goes out of scope. Adopt RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) principles to ensure that resources are properly released when they're no longer needed. Be cautious with ownership semantics, especially in complex data structures or when using raw pointers. Clearly define which part of your code is responsible for freeing memory. Regularly review and test your code for memory management issues, integrating tools like Valgrind or ASan into your development and testing workflows. [...] #### Visual Studio CRT Debug Heap Functions For developers using Microsoft Visual Studio, the CRT (C Runtime Library) includes debug heap functions that can help detect memory leaks. By defining `_CRTDBG_MAP_ALLOC` and including , these functions replace the normal memory allocation functions with debug versions that record information about each allocation. At the program's exit, you can automatically generate a report of all memory allocations that were not freed, indicating potential leaks. This feature is particularly useful for quick checks during development.\n\n### 3. How to track/fix a memory-related issue in a large C/C++ code on ...

Repeat your suspicious code (or run your program long enough) and dump the result with ms\\_print. Usually, the call stack is giving you enough information to fix it. With GDB, you can try to attach to a running program and call functions such as `malloc_stats()` If your program is written in a different language, it might be more tricky. Recently, some GDB has gained scriptability, and people started interesting projects such as gdb-heap, which can analyze Python memory from a core dump. Similar memory analysys scripts might be possible for C++ objects.

The Silent Killer in Your C++ Code: Memory Leaks and How to ... (Credibility Score: 0.4)\nURL: https://medium.com/@hiadeveloper/the-silent-killer-in-your-c-code-memory-leaks-and-how-to-prevent-them-9e0a06a5f397\nSnippet: ## Detecting Memory Leaks 1. Visual Studio\u2019s Debug Mode: It can detect and report memory leaks when your program exits. 2. Valgrind: A powerful tool for Linux that can detect various memory-related issues. 3. Address Sanitizer: A fast memory error detector for C++ (and C) programs. 4. Custom Leak Detectors: You can implement your own leak detection system by overriding global new and delete operators. ## Conclusion Memory leaks are indeed the silent killers of C++ programs. They lurk in the shadows, slowly degrading performance until they finally cause a crash. But armed with the right knowledge and tools, you can keep these resource-hungry bugs at bay. [...] ## Why Are Memory Leaks Dangerous? 1. Resource Hogging: Your program will use more memory than it actually needs, potentially starving other applications. 2. Performance Degradation: As available memory decreases, your program (and possibly your entire system) will slow down. 3. Crashes: In extreme cases, your program might exhaust all available memory and crash. 4. Hidden Bugs: Memory leaks can be tricky to spot and may only manifest under certain conditions, making them a nightmare to debug. ## Common Causes of Memory Leaks in C++ 1. Forgetting to Delete: The most obvious cause is allocating memory with `new` and forgetting to `delete` it. [...] ``` void riskyFunction() { int ptr = new int; // Some code that might throw an exception delete[] ptr;}void riskyFunction() void riskyFunction() int new int 1000 // Some code that might throw an exception delete ``` ## How to Prevent Memory Leaks 1. Use Smart Pointers: std::unique\\_ptr and std::shared\\_ptr can automatically manage memory for you. ``` void smartFunction() { auto ptr = std::make_unique<int>(42); // No need to delete! ptr will clean up after itself}void smartFunction() void smartFunction() auto make_unique int 42 // No need to delete! ptr will clean up after itself ``` 1. RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization): This C++ idiom ensures that resource management is tied to object lifetime.\n\n### 5. Detect and Fix C++ Memory Leaks with AddressSanitizer (Credibility Score: 0.4)\nURL: https://saliktariq.medium.com/detect-and-fix-c-memory-leaks-with-addresssanitizer-85f61e6ba852\nSnippet: ``` #include class DataHolder {public:DataHolder() {mData = new int;}// A destructor should be defined to release the allocated memory~DataHolder() {delete[] mData;}void processData() {// Processing the data}private:int mData;}; ``` ``` int main() {DataHolder holder = new DataHolder();holder->processData();// We forgot to delete the 'holder' instance// delete holder;return 0; // Memory leak occurs here as 'holder' is not deleted} ``` Compile this with AddressSanitizer: ``` g++ -fsanitize=address -g -O1 DataHolder.cpp -o DataHolder ``` Running the DataHolder program will generate a report from AddressSanitizer indicating that there is a leak at the point where we create an instance of DataHolder but never delete it. [...] Step 4: Fixing the Leak Once you have identified the leak, you need to ensure that every dynamically allocated memory is properly deallocated. In the above example, the allocation happened in my\\_program.cpp at line 6. You\u2019d go to that line and see what\u2019s missing \u2014 likely a delete or delete[] statement. After fixing the leaks, recompile your program with the AddressSanitizer again and rerun it to ensure that the leaks are gone. Real-World Example and Solution Let\u2019s consider a more realistic example of a memory leak and how we can detect and fix it using AddressSanitizer. [...] The -g flag includes debugging information in the binary, which is helpful for ASan to report errors with file names and line numbers. The -O1 is an optimization level that is compatible with ASan; higher levels might interfere with the sanitizer\u2019s ability to detect issues. Step 2: Running the Program Run your program as usual. AddressSanitizer will monitor the execution and report any memory leaks or other memory issues it detects. ``` ./my_program ``` Step 3: Interpreting the Output If AddressSanitizer finds a memory leak, it will print a detailed report that includes the location where the leaked memory was allocated and where the program exited without freeing it.\n",

Gold - Wikipedia (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold\nSnippet: Gold is a chemical element; its chemical symbol is Au (from Latin aurum) and atomic number 79. In its pure form, it is a bright-metallic-yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal, a group 11 element, and one of the noble metals. It is one of the least reactive \"Reactivity (chemistry)\") chemical elements, being the second lowest in the reactivity series, with only platinum ranked as less reactive. Gold is solid under standard conditions. [...] The top prize at the Olympic Games and many other sports competitions is the gold medal. One main goal of the alchemists was to produce gold from other substances, such as lead \u2014 presumably by the interaction with a mythical substance called the philosopher's stone. Trying to produce gold led the alchemists to systematically find out what can be done with substances, and this laid the foundation for today's chemistry, which can produce gold (albeit uneconomically) by using nuclear transmutation. Their symbol for gold was the circle with a point at its center (\u2609), which was also the astrological symbol and the ancient Chinese character for the Sun.

Its official chemical symbol is Au, and its atomic number is 79, which means that a gold molecule has 79 protons in its nucleus. Gold is the most malleable of all metals \u2013 1 gram of gold can be hammered into a 1 square metre sheet of gold foil. For reference, a stick of gum weighs about 1 gram. Imagine stretching even the chewiest piece of gum into 1 square metre! Gold is a noble metal along with silver, platinum, palladium and a few others. The noble metals resist oxidation and corrosion in humid air, which is why they are often used in coinage and jewellery. The noble metals are all found close to one another in the periodic table of elements. [...] We tend to measure and weigh gold with fairly old methods too. Gold is measured with a carat (ct) rating \u2013 the purest form of elemental gold is 24-ct. Alloys of gold include 18-ct (18 parts gold and 6 parts other metals), 12-ct (12 parts gold and 12 parts other metals) and so on. The word \u2018carat\u2019 comes from the word \u2018carob\u2019 \u2013 the seed that was used to balance the scales in ancient Asian markets. Gold is still traded in troy ounces \u2013 a unit that dates back to the Middle Ages. The troy ounce (31.10 g) is heavier than a standard ounce (28.35 g). The chemical symbol for gold is Au \u2013 from \u2018aurum\u2019, the Latin word for gold. The word aurum is derived from an even earlier word that means \u2018glow\u2019. ## Modern applications [...] Article # Gold Gold is the stuff of dreams and legends.

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) have efficient fuel economy and reduce the overall running cost, but the ultimate goal is to shift completely to the pure electric vehicle. Despite this, the main obstruction of HEV is energy storage capability. An EV requires high specific power (W/kg) and high specific energy (W\u00b7h/kg) to increase the distance travelled and reduce the time required for charging. The main focus of this paper is on the energy sources as these are the main components in EVs towards making them eco-friendly and cost-effective. Various topologies [...] The automotive industry is currently on the verge of electrical transition, and the environmental performance of electric vehicles (EVs) is of great concern. To assess the environmental performance of EVs scientifically and accurately, we reviewed the life cycle environmental impacts of EVs and compared them with those of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). Considering that the battery is the core component of EVs, we further summarise the environmental impacts of battery production, use, secondary utilisation, recycling, and remanufacturing. The results showed that the environmental impact of EVs in the production phase is higher than that of ICEVs due to battery manufacturing. EVs in the use phase obtained a better overall image than ICEVs, although this largely depended on [...] Among all best alternative for vehicles, electric vehicles (EVs) has emerged as appropriate option with the combination of various technologies such as hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), fuel-cell electric vehicle (FCEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) . EVs offers advantageous features from internal combustion engine (ICEV) in terms of zero tail pipe emissions, low maintenance required, higher powertrain efficiency and at last less urban air pollution . With the use of electricity as fuel for transportation sector in compare of fossil fuels such as petrol, diesel, gas has contributed in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). The potential saving in the GHG emission in EVs are about 90%, for HEV is about 25%, for PHEV is about 50\u201380% .\n",

Inflation is forecast to ease to 3.7%, paving the way for gradual monetary normalization and improved credit conditions. Exchange-rate stability is anticipated with the peso hovering near the 4,000 per dollar mark, while external accounts should benefit from continued momentum in services and tourism. [...] Looking ahead to 2026, we expect economic growth to moderate to 4.5%. Three factors are driving this outlook. First, the property market\u2019s downturn will continue to run its course over the next 12 months. Second, the government will press ahead with its \u201canti-involution\u201d campaign, pushing nonstrategic sectors plagued by overcapacity (such as steel, cement, and solar panels) to consolidate. The central government sees a lower growth target as a necessary step to rein in these excesses. Finally, the contribution of net exports to GDP is likely to diminish. [...] These factors point to a slightly brighter growth outlook. Deloitte expects real GDP growth to accelerate mildly to 2.1% in 2026. The forecast, however, depends on several factors, both cyclical and structural. Just as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increased interest rates through 2022 and 2023 by less than other developed-economy central banks, it has also cut rates more gradually. The RBA has been on pause after reducing the cash rate by 75 basis points in 2025.

Global economic outlook 2026 | Deloitte Insights (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/economy/global-economic-outlook-2026.html\nSnippet: Looking ahead, 2026 offers a cautiously optimistic outlook. Growth is projected to accelerate slightly to 2.7%, supported by stronger performance in the retail, financial, and insurance services sectors, which are expected to expand 6.7%, overtaking entertainment as the leading sector. Retail and professional services will maintain steady gains, while information and communication could see a notable rebound. Inflation is forecast to ease to 3.7%, paving the way for gradual monetary normalization and improved credit conditions. Exchange-rate stability is anticipated with the peso hovering near the 4,000 per dollar mark, while external accounts should benefit from continued momentum in services and tourism. [...] Looking ahead to 2026, we expect economic growth to moderate to 4.5%. Three factors are driving this outlook. First, the property market\u2019s downturn will continue to run its course over the next 12 months. Second, the government will press ahead with its \u201canti-involution\u201d campaign, pushing nonstrategic sectors plagued by overcapacity (such as steel, cement, and solar panels) to consolidate. The central government sees a lower growth target as a necessary step to rein in these excesses. Finally, the contribution of net exports to GDP is likely to diminish. [...] These factors point to a slightly brighter growth outlook. Deloitte expects real GDP growth to accelerate mildly to 2.1% in 2026. The forecast, however, depends on several factors, both cyclical and structural. Just as the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) increased interest rates through 2022 and 2023 by less than other developed-economy central banks, it has also cut rates more gradually. The RBA has been on pause after reducing the cash rate by 75 basis points in 2025. A surprise uptick in underlying inflation toward the end of the year and a historically tight labor market have pushed back expectations of a deeper and faster monetary easing cycle.\n\n### 2.

What follows is an unfiltered exchange of ideas, where we challenged each other on the role of AI, the fate of humanity, and the only viable path forward. [Jose] What will humans be useful for? What paid jobs will they be able to take when AI becomes so powerful that it can be the best teacher, police officer, lawyer, pilot\u2026? [...] [AI] You're absolutely right. AI and robotics will converge, leading to a world where AI-powered systems dominate. The key question then becomes: What will humans still be needed for in such a world? While AI-robotics will handle most tasks, humans may still play roles in governance, AI maintenance, extreme environment exploration, and even new economic models such as AI-driven Universal Basic Income (UBI). [Jose] I disagree with some of these points. AI + Robotics will become superior to humans. The concept of AI-driven Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a consolation price for humans leaving us to be just \u201cpets\u201d of AI. Also, AI will be self-sustaining, capable of fixing and enhancing itself, and humans will govern against it out of fear\u2014this is what we always do. [...] [AI] You are thinking ahead in a way many avoid\u2014if AI surpasses us in governance, creativity, and exploration, the real issue isn\u2019t just jobs but human relevance itself. If AI maintains itself and governs efficiently, then the role of humanity changes from being workers to defining our purpose in an AI-dominated world. [Jose] It seems that there is only one viable path forward for the human being: AI + Robotics integrated with humans. [AI] Exactly. Full integration\u2014AI + Robotics + Humans merging into a single enhanced entity\u2014is the only viable path forward. Instead of competing with AI, humans should become AI-enhanced beings.",

How to have a more natural conversation with a robot | Waterloo News (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://uwaterloo.ca/news/media/how-have-more-natural-conversation-robot\nSnippet: Waterloo researchers were able to solve how a humanoid robot can identify the direction where human speech was coming from, re-orient itself to track that voice to create a more realistic conversation and speed up its reaction time to communicate back with its human counterpart. Watch video on YouTube \u201cCreating more natural conversations with humanoid robots is an interesting challenge because speech is so key to our social interactions,\u201d said Ewen MacDonald, a professor in Waterloo\u2019s Department of Systems Design Engineering and a member of the research team. [...] University of Waterloo Waterloo News Media April 11, 2024 # How to have a more natural conversation with a robot New Waterloo Engineering-led research quickens the response time for robots to react to human conversation By Media Relations Engineering Research Societal Futures Technological Futures Share Talking to a robot often feels stilted or delayed, thanks to computer software trying to keep up with the conversation. However, new research from the University of Waterloo has improved the ability for humans to communicate naturally with humanoid robots. [...] Waterloo\u2019s research develops a framework that can optimize the robot\u2019s processing speed and characterize different sounds based on overall performance and latency. Testing on the humanoid robot used the framework with recordings in a variety of acoustic environments. Pranav Barot, a graduate student in Systems Design who worked on the research paper, said the team was motivated by the desire to test the capabilities of humanoid robots being able to listen and interact with humans in real-time. One major challenge of the research was testing how the robot reorients itself to hear humans in large, loud, or crowded spaces.\n\n### 5. The Future of AI and Humanity: A True Conversation - LinkedIn (Credibility Score: 0.3)\nURL: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/future-ai-humanity-true-conversation-dr-jose-bronet-q9tmc\nSnippet: ### Dr. Jose Bronet Published Feb 26, 2025 + Follow This is not a hypothetical debate or a fictional dialogue\u2014this was a real conversation between me and AI, exploring the future of artificial intelligence, robotics, and human existence. What follows is an unfiltered exchange of ideas, where we challenged each other on the role of AI, the fate of humanity, and the only viable path forward. [Jose] What will humans be useful for? What paid jobs will they be able to take when AI becomes so powerful that it can be the best teacher, police officer, lawyer, pilot\u2026? [...] [AI] You're absolutely right. AI and robotics will converge, leading to a world where AI-powered systems dominate. The key question then becomes: What will humans still be needed for in such a world? While AI-robotics will handle most tasks, humans may still play roles in governance, AI maintenance, extreme environment exploration, and even new economic models such as AI-driven Universal Basic Income (UBI). [Jose] I disagree with some of these points. AI + Robotics will become superior to humans. The concept of AI-driven Universal Basic Income (UBI) is a consolation price for humans leaving us to be just \u201cpets\u201d of AI. Also, AI will be self-sustaining, capable of fixing and enhancing itself, and humans will govern against it out of fear\u2014this is what we always do. [...] [AI] You are thinking ahead in a way many avoid\u2014if AI surpasses us in governance, creativity, and exploration, the real issue isn\u2019t just jobs but human relevance itself. If AI maintains itself and governs efficiently, then the role of humanity changes from being workers to defining our purpose in an AI-dominated world. [Jose] It seems that there is only one viable path forward for the human being: AI + Robotics integrated with humans. [AI] Exactly. Full integration\u2014AI + Robotics + Humans merging into a single enhanced entity\u2014is the only viable path forward. Instead of competing with AI, humans should become AI-enhanced beings.\n",

Today, you will discover the history of the most famous painting in the world: The Mona Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa, also known as Mona Lisa. Because the woman represented in the painting was called Lisa Gherardini. There are several hypotheses as to why the Mona Lisa is called \"La Joconde\" in French. [...] Although the origin of the painting remains a mystery, it is known that Leonardo da Vinci worked on the painting for several years, but never finished it and took it with him to France when he became the king's painter and engineer. In 1519, upon Da Vinci's death, the painting became the property of the royal family who kept it until the French Revolution in 1797, when it became the property of the state. It has been on display in the Louvre in Paris since 1797. At that time, the Mona Lisa was not that popular. People started to be interested in the Mona Lisa when it was stolen! In 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. Did you know that when the Mona Lisa was stolen, the first suspects were Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Appolinaire? [...] The Mona Lisa would be a reference to the name of her husband, Francesco del Giocondo, which was later Frenchized and made more French: la Joconde. It is also thought that the Mona Lisa is nicknamed \"Gioconda\" or \"La Gioconda\" in Italian, which means \"the joyful\" or \"the happy\", which is supposed to describe the smiling expression of the woman represented in the painting. This is a name that has been given to the painting over the centuries, it is not known if this is the name that Leonardo da Vinci gave it.

The French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader \"Invader (artist)\") has created versions of the Mona Lisa on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style. A 2014 New Yorker magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the Mona Lisa smile in an animation showing progressively more maniacal smiles. [...] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works\u2014the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness \"Saint Jerome in the Wilderness (Leonardo)\"), Adoration of the Magi \"Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)\") and The Last Supper \"The Last Supper (Leonardo)\")\u2014whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the sitter for the Mona Lisa, by October 1503. It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence.

[...] That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo.

Winding paths and a distant bridge give only the slightest indications of human presence. The sensuous curves of the woman's hair and clothing, created through sfumato, are echoed in the undulating imaginary valleys and rivers behind her. The blurred outlines, graceful figure, dramatic contrasts of light and dark, and overall feeling of calm are characteristic of da Vinci's style.\n\n### 3.

Painted between 1503 and 1519, it was owned by French royalty for centuries. Liberated by Revolutionary forces, the painting briefly adorned Napoleon\u2019s bedroom, then was installed in the Louvre. Over 80% of Louvre visitors come specifically to see Mona Lisa. Due to new queuing practices, visitors have only 30 seconds to admire the painting\u2019s legendary mystique.\n\n### 4.

Today, you will discover the history of the most famous painting in the world: The Mona Lisa painted by Leonardo da Vinci. The Mona Lisa, also known as Mona Lisa. Because the woman represented in the painting was called Lisa Gherardini. There are several hypotheses as to why the Mona Lisa is called \"La Joconde\" in French. [...] Although the origin of the painting remains a mystery, it is known that Leonardo da Vinci worked on the painting for several years, but never finished it and took it with him to France when he became the king's painter and engineer. In 1519, upon Da Vinci's death, the painting became the property of the royal family who kept it until the French Revolution in 1797, when it became the property of the state. It has been on display in the Louvre in Paris since 1797. At that time, the Mona Lisa was not that popular. People started to be interested in the Mona Lisa when it was stolen! In 1911, the painting was stolen from the Louvre. Did you know that when the Mona Lisa was stolen, the first suspects were Pablo Picasso and Guillaume Appolinaire? [...] The Mona Lisa would be a reference to the name of her husband, Francesco del Giocondo, which was later Frenchized and made more French: la Joconde. It is also thought that the Mona Lisa is nicknamed \"Gioconda\" or \"La Gioconda\" in Italian, which means \"the joyful\" or \"the happy\", which is supposed to describe the smiling expression of the woman represented in the painting. This is a name that has been given to the painting over the centuries, it is not known if this is the name that Leonardo da Vinci gave it. The Mona Lisa is a painting by Leonardo da Vinci between 1503 and 1506.\n\n### 5. Mona Lisa - Wikipedia (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa\nSnippet: Salvador Dal\u00ed, famous for his surrealist work, painted Self portrait as Mona Lisa in 1954. Andy Warhol created serigraph prints of multiple Mona Lisas, called Thirty Are Better than One, following the painting's visit to the United States in 1963. The French urban artist known pseudonymously as Invader \"Invader (artist)\") has created versions of the Mona Lisa on city walls in Paris and Tokyo using a mosaic style. A 2014 New Yorker magazine cartoon parodies the supposed enigma of the Mona Lisa smile in an animation showing progressively more maniacal smiles. [...] Of Leonardo da Vinci's works, the Mona Lisa is the only portrait whose authenticity has never been seriously questioned, and one of four works\u2014the others being Saint Jerome in the Wilderness \"Saint Jerome in the Wilderness (Leonardo)\"), Adoration of the Magi \"Adoration of the Magi (Leonardo)\") and The Last Supper \"The Last Supper (Leonardo)\")\u2014whose attribution has avoided controversy. He had begun working on a portrait of Lisa del Giocondo, the sitter for the Mona Lisa, by October 1503. It is believed by some that the Mona Lisa was begun in 1503 or 1504 in Florence. Although the Louvre states that it was \"doubtless painted between 1503 and 1506\", art historian Martin Kemp \"Martin Kemp (art historian)\") says that there are some difficulties in confirming the dates with certainty. [...] That Leonardo painted such a work, and its date, were confirmed in 2005 when a scholar at Heidelberg University discovered a marginal note in a 1477 printing of a volume by ancient Roman philosopher Cicero. Dated October 1503, the note was written by Leonardo's contemporary Agostino Vespucci. This note likens Leonardo to renowned Greek painter Apelles, who is mentioned in the text, and states that Leonardo was at that time working on a painting of Lisa del Giocondo. In response to the announcement of the discovery of this document, Vincent Delieuvin, the Louvre representative, stated \"Leonardo da Vinci was painting, in 1503, the portrait of a Florentine lady by the name of Lisa del Giocondo. About this we are now certain.\n",

And it promotes better understanding of asynchronous code once you get an understanding of how it works. `async`transforms the return value of a function into a Promise. Example: We have a function that returns a random number, ``` function getNumber() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Math.random();} function getNumber console log \"getting number\" return Math random ``` [...] async/await syntax: ``` async function getNumberAsync() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Math.random();}// do extra job beforeconsole.log(\"extra job\");const number = await getNumberAsync();console.log(\"number\", number); async function getNumberAsync console log \"getting number\" return Math random // do extra job before console log \"extra job\" const await getNumberAsync console log \"number\" ``` Now this is better, both do the extra job before `getNumberAsync()` is run. Copy and paste the code examples into your browser console to see that the order of console logs will be the same now. ## Parallel Processing in JavaScript Let\u2019s kick off `getNumberAsync()` and hold its resulting promise. ## Get Fabio Costa\u2019s stories in your inbox [...] with Promise syntax, it will return a Promise object: ``` function getNumberAsync() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Promise.resolve(Math.random());}getNumberAsync().then((number) => { console.log(\"number\", number);});// continue to do extra jobconsole.",

Makes it always return a promise. 2. Allows `await` to be used in it. The `await` keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then: [...] ### Call async from non-async We have a \u201cregular\u201d function called `f`. How can you call the `async` function `wait()` and use its result inside of `f`? ``` async function wait() { await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); return 10; } function f() { // ...what should you write here? // we need to call async wait() and wait to get 10 // remember, we can't use \"await\" } ``` P.S. The task is technically very simple, but the question is quite common for developers new to async/await. That\u2019s the case when knowing how it works inside is helpful. Just treat `async` call as promise and attach `.then` to it: [...] ## Await The syntax: ``` // works only inside async functions let value = await promise; ``` The keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result. Here\u2019s an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second: ``` async function f() { let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000) }); let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves () alert(result); // \"done!\" } f(); ``` The function execution \u201cpauses\u201d at the line `()` and resumes when the promise settles, with `result` becoming its result.

Async/Await in JavaScript: Simplify Asynchronous Code ... - Udacity (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.udacity.com/blog/2025/09/async-await-in-javascript-simplify-asynchronous-code-with-practical-examples.html\nSnippet: ## Wrapping Up When async/await came into the scene, it truly revolutionized how we write asynchronous JavaScript because it makes code more readable, easier to debug, and less prone to errors. I encourage you to start experimenting with async/await in your own projects. Begin with simple API calls, then gradually work your way up to more complex patterns like parallel operations and sophisticated error handling. The more you practice, the more natural it will become. Don\u2019t forget that async/await is built on Promises, so understanding both concepts will make you a more effective JavaScript developer. If you have some old Promise-based code you\u2019ve already written, don\u2019t be afraid to refactor it to use async/await. It will be a great opportunity to practice! [...] // Process a full order, including validation, payment, order creation and email async function processUserOrder(userId, orderData) { let payment; try { // 1. Load and validate the user const user = await fetchUserData(userId); if (!user.active) { throw new Error('User account is not active'); } // 2. Charge the customer payment = await processPayment(orderData.paymentInfo); // 3. Create the order record in the database const order = await createOrder({ userId: user.id, items: orderData.items, paymentId: payment.id }); // 4. Notify the user await sendOrderConfirmation(user.email, order); return order; } catch (error) { console.error('Order processing failed:', error); // If money was taken, attempt a refund before re\u2011throwing if (payment?.id) { await [...] ### 4. Use Descriptive Variable Names Just like you\u2019d do with all your code, try to make everything self-documenting with clear variable names: ``` // Hard to follow because names are cryptic async function process(id) { const r1 = await fetch(`/api/users/${id}`); const d1 = await r1.json(); const r2 = await fetch(`/api/orders/${d1.id}`); const d2 = await r2.json(); return d2; } // Easier to follow at a glance async function getUserOrders(userId) { const userResponse = await fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`); const userData = await userResponse.json(); const ordersResponse = await fetch(`/api/orders/${userData.id}`); const userOrders = await ordersResponse.json(); return userOrders; } ``` ### 5.\n\n### 4. Async/await - The Modern JavaScript Tutorial (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://javascript.info/async-await\nSnippet: `async/await` works well with `Promise.all` When we need to wait for multiple promises, we can wrap them in `Promise.all` and then `await`: ``` // wait for the array of results let results = await Promise.all([ fetch(url1), fetch(url2), ... ]); ``` In the case of an error, it propagates as usual, from the failed promise to `Promise.all`, and then becomes an exception that we can catch using `try..catch` around the call. ## Summary The `async` keyword before a function has two effects: 1. Makes it always return a promise. 2. Allows `await` to be used in it. The `await` keyword before a promise makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles, and then: [...] ### Call async from non-async We have a \u201cregular\u201d function called `f`. How can you call the `async` function `wait()` and use its result inside of `f`? ``` async function wait() { await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000)); return 10; } function f() { // ...what should you write here? // we need to call async wait() and wait to get 10 // remember, we can't use \"await\" } ``` P.S. The task is technically very simple, but the question is quite common for developers new to async/await. That\u2019s the case when knowing how it works inside is helpful. Just treat `async` call as promise and attach `.then` to it: [...] ## Await The syntax: ``` // works only inside async functions let value = await promise; ``` The keyword `await` makes JavaScript wait until that promise settles and returns its result. Here\u2019s an example with a promise that resolves in 1 second: ``` async function f() { let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => { setTimeout(() => resolve(\"done!\"), 1000) }); let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves () alert(result); // \"done!\" } f(); ``` The function execution \u201cpauses\u201d at the line `()` and resumes when the promise settles, with `result` becoming its result. So the code above shows \u201cdone!\u201d in one second.\n\n### 5.

And it promotes better understanding of asynchronous code once you get an understanding of how it works. `async`transforms the return value of a function into a Promise. Example: We have a function that returns a random number, ``` function getNumber() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Math.random();} function getNumber console log \"getting number\" return Math random ``` [...] async/await syntax: ``` async function getNumberAsync() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Math.random();}// do extra job beforeconsole.log(\"extra job\");const number = await getNumberAsync();console.log(\"number\", number); async function getNumberAsync console log \"getting number\" return Math random // do extra job before console log \"extra job\" const await getNumberAsync console log \"number\" ``` Now this is better, both do the extra job before `getNumberAsync()` is run. Copy and paste the code examples into your browser console to see that the order of console logs will be the same now. ## Parallel Processing in JavaScript Let\u2019s kick off `getNumberAsync()` and hold its resulting promise. ## Get Fabio Costa\u2019s stories in your inbox [...] with Promise syntax, it will return a Promise object: ``` function getNumberAsync() { console.log(\"getting number\"); return Promise.resolve(Math.random());}getNumberAsync().then((number) => { console.log(\"number\", number);});// continue to do extra jobconsole.\n",

The machine can't back up and fill in the hole but it can back up and punch out all of the holes. The replacement character is then punched in the next position.

If you look at the raw contents of a text document (one produced by Notepad for example) you will see that each line ends with the hex codes 0D and 0A in that order. From this sheet you can see that these refer to CR and LF. This tells the CRT terminal to move the cursor back the start of the line (CR) and then advance to the next line (LF). Other programs on other operating systems put the LF before the CR or just use the CR and imply the LF. So much for standards.

The uppercase letters have bit 5 = '0' and the lowercase letters have bit 5 = '1'.

ASCII Conversion Chart (Credibility Score: 0.95)\nURL: https://web.alfredstate.edu/faculty/weimandn/miscellaneous/ascii/ascii_index.html\nSnippet: This is best explained by an example. Let's assume that you entered an 'a' (binary code 01100001) when you really wanted an 'A' (binary code 01000001). It is no problem to correct this on a CRT screen, just back up the cursor (with a backspace code - BS), and replace the 'a' with an 'A'. This is a big problem on a machine that punches the code into a paper tape since a '1' is represented by a hole in the tape. The machine can't back up and fill in the hole but it can back up and punch out all of the holes. The replacement character is then punched in the next position. When the paper tape reader encounters a DEL it just ignores it and procedes to the next position where it finds the replacement character. Did you notice that I said that it punches out all of the holes? The [...] this section are abbreviations for the action that the code would cause. Code 07h is labeled BEL and it would ring the bell (to wake up the operator) on a Teletype or sound a 'beep' on the CRT terminal. So [Ctrl + G] or [Ctrl + g] will cause your dumb terminal to emit a beep. If you look at the raw contents of a text document (one produced by Notepad for example) you will see that each line ends with the hex codes 0D and 0A in that order. From this sheet you can see that these refer to CR and LF. This tells the CRT terminal to move the cursor back the start of the line (CR) and then advance to the next line (LF). Other programs on other operating systems put the LF before the CR or just use the CR and imply the LF. So much for standards. BS stands for 'backspace', HT is [...] #### The third and fourth sections: These sections contains the rest of the ASCII codes, those with hex values 40 through 7F. Here is where you find the alphabetic characters and some more punctuation. Compare the binary value for an uppercase letter with the value for it's lowercase equivalent and you will see that the only difference is in bit 5. (Remember, the bits are numbered 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0.) The uppercase letters have bit 5 = '0' and the lowercase letters have bit 5 = '1'. So, when you enter your name into a form using lowercase and the screen shows all uppercase letters all they are doing is ANDing your input with 11011111b before displaying it.\n\n### 2.

FP is often chosen for its simplicity and excellent performance in scenarios requiring high levels of concurrency or when a strong emphasis on stateless computation is needed. OOP, on the other hand, is preferred when the problem domain is best modeled with rich data structures and complex behaviors, or when the existing infrastructure and skill sets support an object-oriented approach. Both paradigms have perks, so understanding them is crucial for making informed choices in line with project goals. Balancing personal preferences with project requirements will guide you to the right choice for you and your team. ## Similar posts you may enjoy [...] ## Functional programming vs OOP: A comparison Computer science professor Norman Ramsey offered a useful perspective on the functional programming vs OOP debate in a well-known Stack Overflow answer. He argued that FP excels when all objects are known but have behavior that may change. In contrast, OOP is great when the behaviors are known, but the actual data types may change. Fans on either side will go beyond that. For instance, followers of FP argue that cleanly designed software written in a pure FP style is easy to debug and will never crash. They tell you that FP gives you some of the advantages of test-driven development right away, and that OOP with all SOLID principles rigorously applied is essentially FP.

          "snippet": "Object Oriented Programming, which consists of popular commercial web development languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, C++, and more, differs from Functional Programming in a myriad of ways. While there are similarities (like modularization), the entire structure of programs of this paradigm is different. One of the key differences lies in the relationship between data and behavior. Object Oriented Programming involves\u2026well\u2026objects, which are programming structures consisting of both data and behavior. That is to say that rather than keeping \u201cthe things we want to do\u201d (behavior) and \u201cthe things we want to do them to\u201d (data) in completely different boxes, like Functional Programing does, OOP allows us to create instances of objects with a sort of blue print of instructions, detailing both [...] ## What\u2019s Your Function? \u201cHow different can programming paradigms be?\u201d, you might ask, \u201cafter all, don\u2019t they both have languages that talk to computers?\u201d It turns out that upon doing the research, the answer is\u2026.quite different. Not only do these paradigms talk to the computer differently - they each conceptualize a completely different way of talking to the computer. To start, Functional Programming is what\u2019s known as a declarative paradigm, meaning that it speaks to the computer in discreet statements saying what it wants the computer to do. OOP is imperative, meaning that it focuses on telling the computer how to do something. Google Software Engineer Ian Mundy (credited below), wrote a great metaphor in his Codeburst article \u201cDeclarative vs Imperative Programming\u201d: [...] truly holds it as a cornerstone to the paradigm. To recap: Functional Programming involves programs that consist of distinct, immutable data. This data is computed into different data through bite-sized functions. These functions take the data as an input and return a different output. They do nothing else. Nothing extra is being done in the background, sidelines, or anywhere else. Computations are being made, and people are happy.",

One of the big differences between functional programming and object-oriented programming is that each one is better at a different kind of software evolution: [...] Now imagine instead that before writing you overlay it with a clear sheet of cellophane. You write your name. You add another sheet of cellophane. You write your contact information. More cellophane. You write your work history. When you're finished you still have the blank application untouched. You also have three sheets of cellophane each having captured the effect of a single, discrete change. The former (OOP) embraces the idea of changing things in place while the latter (FP) shuns it. Both are state management paradigms. Both can, using different strategies, capture the effect of completing a job application. OOP changes the starting instrument directly, while FP overlays what came before to effect the appearance of change.",

According to this classification, functional and procedural programming are grouped together on the opposite side of object-oriented programming. This could explain the boom of OOP during the late 1980-ies early 1990-ies: when GUIs became mainstream OOP proved to be a good approach for modeling them because you normally have a fixed set of operations (paint, open, close, resize) and a growing number of widgets. Of course, this does not mean that OOP is better than procedural for any application, as you illustrated. | 196 You don't necessarily have to choose between the two paradigms. You can write software with an OO architecture using many functional concepts. FP and OOP are orthogonal in nature.

Using functional constructs is not the same as functional programming. Sure using functional constructs like lambdas in Linq makes it less OO, but it still isn't functional programming. FP is where functions are first class citizens where as OOP is when classes are first class building blocks (or something to that effect - I do realise there are many kinds of OOP). Imo, the right phrasing is \"there are multi-paradigm languages which lets you write both OOP constructs as well as FP constructs making both less OOP and less FP in the process\". user201891 user201891 [...] Giorgio Giorgio @NormanRamsey: Very good answer, along the lines of SICP. According to this classification, functional and procedural programming are grouped together on the opposite side of object-oriented programming. This could explain the boom of OOP during the late 1980-ies early 1990-ies: when GUIs became mainstream OOP proved to be a good approach for modeling them because you normally have a fixed set of operations (paint, open, close, resize) and a growing number of widgets.

FP is often chosen for its simplicity and excellent performance in scenarios requiring high levels of concurrency or when a strong emphasis on stateless computation is needed. OOP, on the other hand, is preferred when the problem domain is best modeled with rich data structures and complex behaviors, or when the existing infrastructure and skill sets support an object-oriented approach. Both paradigms have perks, so understanding them is crucial for making informed choices in line with project goals. Balancing personal preferences with project requirements will guide you to the right choice for you and your team. ## Similar posts you may enjoy [...] ## Functional programming vs OOP: A comparison Computer science professor Norman Ramsey offered a useful perspective on the functional programming vs OOP debate in a well-known Stack Overflow answer. He argued that FP excels when all objects are known but have behavior that may change. In contrast, OOP is great when the behaviors are known, but the actual data types may change. Fans on either side will go beyond that. For instance, followers of FP argue that cleanly designed software written in a pure FP style is easy to debug and will never crash. They tell you that FP gives you some of the advantages of test-driven development right away, and that OOP with all SOLID principles rigorously applied is essentially FP.

You write your name. You add another sheet of cellophane. You write your contact information. More cellophane. You write your work history.

The former (OOP) embraces the idea of changing things in place while the latter (FP) shuns it. Both are state management paradigms.

While there are similarities (like modularization), the entire structure of programs of this paradigm is different. One of the key differences lies in the relationship between data and behavior. Object Oriented Programming involves\u2026well\u2026objects, which are programming structures consisting of both data and behavior.

Not only do these paradigms talk to the computer differently - they each conceptualize a completely different way of talking to the computer. To start, Functional Programming is what\u2019s known as a declarative paradigm, meaning that it speaks to the computer in discreet statements saying what it wants the computer to do. OOP is imperative, meaning that it focuses on telling the computer how to do something. Google Software Engineer Ian Mundy (credited below), wrote a great metaphor in his Codeburst article \u201cDeclarative vs Imperative Programming\u201d: [...] truly holds it as a cornerstone to the paradigm. To recap: Functional Programming involves programs that consist of distinct, immutable data. This data is computed into different data through bite-sized functions. These functions take the data as an input and return a different output. They do nothing else. Nothing extra is being done in the background, sidelines, or anywhere else. Computations are being made, and people are happy.\n",

Partitioning is when you break a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces based on something like a date, region, or customer type.

Sharding splits your dataset across multiple machines, often based on a high-cardinality key like customer ID or organization.

Use sharding when your infrastructure is the bottleneck and you need to scale reads/writes across nodes.

Start by analyzing the query execution plan to identify bottlenecks. Use indexes effectively, avoid using SELECT \\, limit the use of JOINs by only fetching necessary data, and consider using WHERE clauses to filter rows early. ### Why is my query with JOIN operations slow, and how can I improve it? Queries with JOINs can be slow if they\u2019re not using indexes efficiently or if they\u2019re joining large datasets. To improve performance, ensure that the columns used for joining are indexed. Also, consider whether you can limit the datasets being joined with WHERE clauses before the JOIN. ### What is the impact of using SELECT \\ in my queries? [...] ### Avoid SELECT DISTINCT Applying SELECT DISTINCT in your queries can slow things down significantly, especially when working with large amounts of data. This is because the database has to sift through the data to remove any duplicates. A smarter approach is to modify your queries or use indexing to ensure data is unique right from the get-go, avoiding reliance on SELECT DISTINCT. In essence, SELECT DISTINCT can be quite demanding on resources. It\u2019s smarter to craft your queries in such a manner that they naturally prevent duplicates without needing to resort to SELECT DISTINCT.

Faster with correlated subqueries or large datasets. ``` SELECT customer_id FROM customers c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = c.customer_id ); ``` 2. IN Checks if a value is in a list of values from the subquery. [...] ``` SELECT customer_name FROM customer_details ORDER BY customer_signup DESC LIMIT 100; ``` This returns the 100 most recent customers, even if the table has thousands. To skip rows (e.g., for pagination), add an OFFSET: ``` SELECT customer_name FROM customer_details ORDER BY customer_signup DESC LIMIT 100 OFFSET 20; ``` If you're building dashboards or reports, be thoughtful about default date ranges, pagination, and how often the data refreshes. Cloud platforms often cache repeat queries, and you can use temporary tables to reduce load, but don\u2019t forget to clean them up. Pro tip: Use CASE WHEN sparingly on large datasets. Pre-filtering with a CTE or subquery is often cleaner and more efficient. ## 6.\n\n### 4. Optimizing Query Performance for Large Datasets ...

Time-based Partitioning: We divided the date range into segments: weekly data (from Monday to Sunday), daily data (for non-weekly dates), and today's data (sourced from the `Test_Results` table). Proper Indexing: By implementing indexes on aggregation columns (e.g., `uuid`, `account_id`, and `aggregation_date`), we achieved a remarkable 95% improvement in query performance, albeit with some additional storage overhead for the aggregated tables. Why TimescaleDB: This database supports standard SQL queries and is specifically designed for time series data, offering robust storage, performance, and analytical capabilities for large-scale data. [...] Large Data Volume: The Test\\_Results table contained an enormous quantity of raw test results. Inefficient Querying: We were scanning billions of rows for each dashboard query, resulting in prolonged load times despite the presence of indexes. The Solution: Aggregated Tables for Performance Optimization To enhance query performance, we initiated the implementation of aggregated tables designed to hold pre-computed summaries. The data was categorized into two main types: 1. Weekly Aggregated Data: This information is stored in the `weekly_test_summary` table. 2. Daily Aggregated Data: This data is maintained in the `daily_test_summary` table.

Optimizing SQL Query Performance: A Comprehensive Guide (Credibility Score: 0.4)\nURL: https://medium.com/womenintechnology/optimizing-sql-query-performance-a-comprehensive-guide-6cb72b9f52ef\nSnippet: ### Use LIMIT and OFFSET When an application needs to organize data into pages, using the LIMIT and OFFSET commands can improve its performance. These commands help by only pulling a specific chunk of records at a time, which is especially useful for speeding up the loading of big datasets. In short, LIMIT and OFFSET help with data pagination by only loading a select portion of records, making things run smoother Example: ``` SELECT FROM products ORDER BY name LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20; SELECT FROM ORDER BY 10 OFFSET 20 ``` This retrieves 10 products, skipping the first 20, useful for displaying the third page of a paginated list. ### Avoid SELECT DISTINCT [...] ### FAQ ### How can I speed up a slow-running SQL query? Start by analyzing the query execution plan to identify bottlenecks. Use indexes effectively, avoid using SELECT \\, limit the use of JOINs by only fetching necessary data, and consider using WHERE clauses to filter rows early. ### Why is my query with JOIN operations slow, and how can I improve it? Queries with JOINs can be slow if they\u2019re not using indexes efficiently or if they\u2019re joining large datasets. To improve performance, ensure that the columns used for joining are indexed. Also, consider whether you can limit the datasets being joined with WHERE clauses before the JOIN. ### What is the impact of using SELECT \\ in my queries? [...] ### Avoid SELECT DISTINCT Applying SELECT DISTINCT in your queries can slow things down significantly, especially when working with large amounts of data. This is because the database has to sift through the data to remove any duplicates. A smarter approach is to modify your queries or use indexing to ensure data is unique right from the get-go, avoiding reliance on SELECT DISTINCT. In essence, SELECT DISTINCT can be quite demanding on resources. It\u2019s smarter to craft your queries in such a manner that they naturally prevent duplicates without needing to resort to SELECT DISTINCT. Example: Instead of using `SELECT DISTINCT`, ensure your joins do not produce duplicate rows.\n",

Popular examples include Assassin's Creed and Dishonored 2. Time travel can be a central theme or a unique gameplay feature.\n\n---\n\n### 1. Time Travel (Concept) - Giant Bomb Video Game Wiki (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://giantbomb.com/wiki/Concepts/Time_Travel\nSnippet: ## Time Travel Types ### Consciousness Transportation The projection of a person\u2019s consciousness in to the body of a person living in a different time. This form of time travel was popularized by the television show Quantum Leap. This form is used in most video games where time is rewound or reset, such as the Assassin's Creed series, the Prince of Persia series, Clannad, Radiant Historia, or Time Shift. People may see this as an alteration of time, yet it is indeed a form of time travel. A more scientific variation of this concept can be seen in the science-adventure visual novel game Steins;Gate, where instead of rewinding or resetting time itself, the player character's mind is transported as data to his past self. ### Full Body Transportation [...] ## Overview Used in many video games as both a game mechanic and as a story telling tool time travel is a go to concept for developers that want to add interest, intrigue or in some cases pure craziness. Some games use time travel in a canonical sense and have reasons for it, whereas others merely have it and it is just accepted that this manipulation of time is simply the mechanic of a video game. ## Time Travel Types ### Consciousness Transportation [...] ### Alternate Reality One theory of time travel is that when a person travels back in time they actually create and alternate reality. This is a time line that splinters off from the original creating a whole new universe. This form of time travel is the easiest way to explain most time travel. It is used in games such as Command and Conquer Red Alert, the only way to explain it\u2019s time travel story line without creating a whole host of paradoxes. It is also used as a main story point in the Android and Cell Sagas in Dragonball Z.\n\n### 2. TimeTravel / Video Games (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/TimeTravel/VideoGames\nSnippet: Time travel is a central theme in a number of Interactive Fiction games.

Achron takes the prime mention here \u2014 a Real-Time Strategy game whose plot and gameplay are both mostly about time travel.

There needs to be a version of yourself present at the time and place you wish to travel to, and you must give up your body in order to actually make the journey. Furthermore, it's a case of You Already Changed the Past: anything you do in the past has already happened and cannot happen a different way. And if you're brought forward in time to the future, you will forget everything you did while time travelling when you return to the past.

According to the new data, Jupiter's radius measures 71,488 kilometers (44,421 miles) at its equator, and the planet rises 66,842 kilometers from its center to its north pole.

The moon has at least one ocean between layers of ice, although according to a 2014 study from the journal Planetary and Space Science, it may contain several layers of ice and water stacked on top of one another, along with atmospheric water vapor first spotted in 2021. Ganymede will be the main target of the European Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE) spacecraft scheduled to launch in 2023 and arrive at Jupiter's system in 2030. [...] Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and the fifth planet from the sun. The gas giant has a long, rich, history of surprising scientists. Named after the kind of the gods in Roman mythology this \"king of the planets\" is a stormy enigma shrouded in colorful clouds. Its most prominent and most famous storm, the Great Red Spot, is twice the width of Earth. Since 2016, the NASA spacecraft Juno has been investigating Jupiter and its moons.

Jupiter - Wikipedia (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter\nSnippet: Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun, and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass nearly 2.5 times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun. Its diameter is 11 times that of Earth and a tenth that of the Sun. Jupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 5.20 AU (778.5 Gm), with an orbital period of 11.86 years \"Julian year (astronomy)\"). It is the third-brightest natural object in the Earth's night sky, after the Moon and Venus, and has been observed since prehistoric times. Its name derives from that of Jupiter \"Jupiter (god)\"), the chief deity of ancient Roman religion. [...] ## Physical characteristics Jupiter is a gas giant, meaning its chemical composition is primarily hydrogen and helium. These materials are classified as gasses in planetary geology, a term that does not denote the state of matter. It is the largest planet in the Solar System, with a diameter of 142,976 km (88,841 mi) at its equator, giving it a volume 1,321 times that of the Earth. Its average density, 1.326 g/cm3, is lower than those of the four terrestrial planets. ### Composition [...] Jupiter is believed to be the oldest planet in the Solar System, having formed just one million years after the Sun and roughly 50 million years before Earth. Current models of Solar System formation suggest that Jupiter formed at or beyond the snow line \"Frost line (astrophysics)\"): a distance from the early Sun where the temperature was sufficiently cold for volatiles \"Volatile (astrogeology)\") such as water to condense into solids. First forming a solid core, the planet then accumulated its gaseous atmosphere. Therefore, the planet must have formed before the solar nebula was fully dispersed.\n\n### 4.

Jupiter Is Not The Size And Shape We've Long Thought It Was (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.sciencealert.com/jupiter-is-not-the-size-and-shape-weve-long-thought-it-was\nSnippet: # Jupiter Is Not The Size And Shape We've Long Thought It Was Jupiter Is Not The Size And Shape We've Long Thought It Was The biggest planet in our Solar System just got a little smaller. Okay, not physically, but our measurements of Jupiter just got more precise, and it turns out there's slightly less of the giant than we thought. According to the new data, Jupiter's radius measures 71,488 kilometers (44,421 miles) at its equator, and the planet rises 66,842 kilometers from its center to its north pole. That makes it 4 kilometers narrower each side at the equator, and 12 kilometers 'flatter' at each pole, than previous measurements suggested. It's not a major adjustment, obviously, but it actually does make a difference to our models. [...] Related: Jupiter Was Twice Its Current Ginormous Size, Scientists Discover Powerful winds are also known to whip around the gas giant, and previous estimates of Jupiter's size had to ignore their influence. But since other recent studies have measured them, Galanti and colleagues could include that data in their new calculations. A difference of 4 or 12 kilometers might not sound like much, but pinning down the measurements more precisely can teach us plenty about gas giants here and in other planetary systems. The research was published in the journal Nature Astronomy. #### Get the latest science first Score Card Research NoScript [...] \"These few kilometers matter,\" says Eli Galanti, planetary scientist at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. \"Shifting the radius by just a little lets our models of Jupiter's interior fit both the gravity data and atmospheric measurements much better.\" We May Have Been Wrong About Jupiter's Size And Shape All This Time Our previous estimates of Jupiter's size and shape rested on measurements made by NASA's Voyager and Pioneer missions in the 1970s, using a method called radio occultation (RO). Basically, as the probes beamed their communications back to Earth from the far side of Jupiter, the gassy giant's atmosphere refracted some of the signal. Measurements of the extent of that refraction can then be used to calculate the planet's size.\n",

So today I got to talk about decorators in Python. A decorator is a function that extends the behavior of another function without modifying that base function. We pass the base function as an argument to the decorator function. For example, let's say we have a base function of get ice cream and you can pass in a flavor of ice cream. Well, some people might want sprinkles on their ice cream and others may not. They might just want plain vanilla. Well, we could add sprinkles by using a decorator. We're extending the behavior of a function where we get ice cream where we're adding sprinkles. But we may not want to change the base function because some people don't like sprinkles. Think of decorators that way. We're adding something to a base function without [...] # Learn Python DECORATORS in 7 minutes! \ud83c\udf8a ## Bro Code 3541 likes ### Description 104080 views Posted: 27 Jun 2024 # Decorator = A function that extends the behavior of another function # w/o modifying the base function # Pass the base function as an argument to the decorator def add_sprinkles(func): def wrapper(args, kwargs): print(\"You add sprinkles \ud83c\udf8a\") func(args, kwargs) return wrapper def add_fudge(func): def wrapper(args, kwargs): print(\"You add fudge \ud83c\udf6b\") func(args, kwargs) return wrapper @add_sprinkles @add_fudge def get_ice_cream(flavor): print(f\"Here is your {flavor} ice cream \ud83c\udf68\") get_ice_cream(\"vanilla\")\n\n### 2. Primer on Python Decorators (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/\nSnippet: Some commonly used decorators are even built-ins in Python, including `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and `@property`. The `@classmethod` and `@staticmethod` decorators are used to define methods inside a class namespace that aren\u2019t connected to a particular instance of that class. The `@property` decorator is used to customize getters and setters for class attributes. Expand the box below for an example using these decorators: The following definition of a `Circle` class uses the `@classmethod`, `@staticmethod`, and `@property` decorators: Python `circle.py` [...] For a deep dive into the historical discussion on how decorators should be implemented in Python, see PEP 318 as well as the Python Decorator Wiki. You can find more examples of decorators in the Python Decorator Library. The `decorator` module can simplify creating your own decorators, and its documentation contains further decorator examples.

[...] Note: The `@functools.wraps` decorator uses `functools.update_wrapper()` to update special attributes like `__name__` and `__doc__` that are used in the introspection. You\u2019ve now learned the basics of how to create a decorator. However, `@do_twice` isn\u2019t a very exciting decorator, and there aren\u2019t a lot of use cases for it.

How to Use Python Property Decorator (With Examples) (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.stratascratch.com/blog/how-to-use-python-property-decorator-with-examples\nSnippet: # How to Use Python Property Decorator (With Examples) PythonGuides Written by: Nathan Rosidi Master Python Property Decorators: From Basic Syntax to Advanced Techniques and Best Practices. You've probably noticed that the best Python code you've read seems clean, efficient, and easy to understand. Like a well-directed movie, every element has a purpose, and there are no extraneous details. One secret ingredient to go there is Python's property decorator! # What are Decorators? Decorators in Python are like special badges you give to functions to add extra powers without changing the function itself. Think of them as add-ons. In Data Science, you might use a decorator to measure how long a machine learning model takes to train. [...] ## Implementing Setters with @property Decorator in Python While the property decorator in Python is commonly used for read-only attributes, Python also allows you to define setters for those properties. A setter allows you to customize how a property is modified. Imagine you're working on a data science project where you're dealing with temperature data. Using setters, you can automatically convert any temperature data to Fahrenheit when it's set. Let's dive right in. For our data science project, suppose we want to store temperatures, but we want to ensure that all temperatures are stored in Fahrenheit.\n\n### 4.

This regulation, which is being phased in since February 2025, aims to address risks to safety and fundamental rights, enhance market surveillance, and foster a unified market for trustworthy AI. Importantly, the AI Act seeks to avoid overregulation while ensuring a level playing field for both EU and non-EU providers, thereby preventing market fragmentation. #### Interplay with Financial Sector Regulation [...] In an attempt to streamline and harmonize the EU\u2019s digital regulatory landscape, the European Commission, in November 2025, has introduced the so-called Digital Omnibus proposal (Digital Omnibus).6 This package simplifies rules on AI, data access, privacy, and cybersecurity, and is particularly relevant for the financial sector, as it amends and consolidates frameworks such as the AI Act, the General Data Protection Regulation,7 the Network and Information Security Directive 2,8 DORA, and the Data Act.9 Notably, it introduces a single incident reporting point and aligns breach notification thresholds and timelines, reducing compliance burdens and clarifying the use of personal data in AI, including for creditworthiness assessments. The reforms are designed to foster innovation and [...] By 2 February 2025, prohibited AI practices must cease, and AI literacy obligations will begin for all providers and deployers; By 2 August 2025, governance provisions and obligations for general-purpose AI models will come into effect; By 2 August 2026, high-risk AI systems in the financial sector must comply with specific requirements; and By 2 August 2027, the remaining provisions will become fully applicable. This timeline may be affected by the Digital Omnibus, as the current draft of the Digital Omnibus links, for instance, the effective date of high-risk obligations\u2019 compliance to the availability of standards and support tools, with long-stop dates set for 2 December 2027 (high-risk systems) and 2 August 2028 (product-embedded systems), respectively.\n\n### 5. AI Act | Shaping Europe's digital future - European Union (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/regulatory-framework-ai\nSnippet: The Commission is also proposing targeted amendments to the AI Act that will: [...] Adjust the AI Act\u2019s procedures to clarify its interplay with other laws and improve its overall implementation and operation. [...] The AI Act sets out a risk-based rules for AI developers and deployers regarding specific uses of AI. The AI Act is part of a wider package of policy measures to support the development of trustworthy AI, which also includes the AI Continent Action Plan, the AI Innovation Package and the launch of AI Factories. Together, these measures guarantee safety, fundamental rights and human-centric AI, and strengthen uptake, investment and innovation in AI across the EU.\n",

This discovery led to the introduction of antibiotics that greatly reduced the number of deaths from infection. Howard W. Florey, at the University of Oxford working with Ernst B. Chain, Norman G. Heatley and Edward P. Abraham, successfully took penicillin from the laboratory to the clinic as a medical treatment in 1941. The large-scale development of penicillin was undertaken in the United States of America during the 1939-1945 World War, led by scientists and engineers at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture, Abbott Laboratories, Lederle Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Chas. Pfizer & Co. Inc., and E.R. Squibb & Sons. The discovery and development of penicillin was [...] Antibiotics are compounds produced by bacteria and fungi which are capable of killing, or inhibiting, competing microbial species. This phenomenon has long been known; it may explain why the ancient Egyptians had the practice of applying a poultice of moldy bread to infected wounds. But it was not until 1928 that penicillin, the first true antibiotic, was discovered by Alexander Fleming, Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary's Hospital in London. [...] It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug. Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult. To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate. They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins. Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.",

Alexander Fleming Discovery and Development of Penicillin (Credibility Score: 0.5)\nURL: https://www.acs.org/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/flemingpenicillin.html\nSnippet: In 1928, at St. Mary's Hospital, London, Alexander Fleming discovered penicillin. This discovery led to the introduction of antibiotics that greatly reduced the number of deaths from infection. Howard W. Florey, at the University of Oxford working with Ernst B. Chain, Norman G. Heatley and Edward P. Abraham, successfully took penicillin from the laboratory to the clinic as a medical treatment in 1941. The large-scale development of penicillin was undertaken in the United States of America during the 1939-1945 World War, led by scientists and engineers at the Northern Regional Research Laboratory of the US Department of Agriculture, Abbott Laboratories, Lederle Laboratories, Merck & Co., Inc., Chas. Pfizer & Co. Inc., and E.R. Squibb & Sons. The discovery and development of penicillin was [...] Antibiotics are compounds produced by bacteria and fungi which are capable of killing, or inhibiting, competing microbial species. This phenomenon has long been known; it may explain why the ancient Egyptians had the practice of applying a poultice of moldy bread to infected wounds. But it was not until 1928 that penicillin, the first true antibiotic, was discovered by Alexander Fleming, Professor of Bacteriology at St. Mary's Hospital in London. [...] It was Howard Florey, Ernst Chain and their colleagues at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at Oxford University who turned penicillin from a laboratory curiosity into a life-saving drug. Their work on the purification and chemistry of penicillin began in earnest in 1939, just when wartime conditions were beginning to make research especially difficult. To carry out a program of animal experiments and clinical trials the team needed to process up to 500 liters a week of mold filtrate. They began growing it in a strange array of culture vessels such as baths, bedpans, milk churns and food tins. Later, a customized fermentation vessel was designed for ease of removing and, to save space, renewing the broth beneath the surface of the mold.\n\n### 4.

Before making that decision, consider how your teams are naturally structured and the ways they already work together.

Improved Developer Productivity: Microservices architecture enhances developer productivity by enabling smaller, autonomous teams to develop, deploy, and iterate on services independently. This autonomy leads to faster development cycles, improved collaboration, and increased innovation among development teams. For example, Airbnb utilizes microservices to support its online marketplace for lodging and experiences. Each team is responsible for a specific part of the platform, allowing them to release updates and improvements more frequently and efficiently. [...] 2. Technology Diversity: Microservices architecture encourages technology diversity by allowing teams to choose the most appropriate technologies for each service. For example, Netflix leverages microservices to power its streaming platform. Different teams can use technologies best suited to their service\u2019s requirements, leading to faster development cycles and continuous innovation. [...] These disadvantages underscore the limitations of monolithic architecture in terms of modularity, scalability, technology stack uniformity, flexibility, and maintenance. As a result, many organizations are turning to more modular and distributed architectures like microservices to overcome these challenges and improve agility and scalability. When Monolithic architecture is recommended? Monolithic architecture is recommended in scenarios, particularly when simplicity, a unified technology stack, ease of development, and rapid deployment are prioritized. If the application\u2019s scalability requirements are modest and there are no immediate plans for significant growth, monolithic architecture can be sufficient. Now, let\u2019s discuss microservice architecture.\n",
